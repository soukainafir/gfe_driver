    /**
     * Create an instance of the wrapper for GraphOne
     * @param is_graph_directed: whether the underlying graph should be directed or undirected
     * @param use_vertex2id_mapping: true for sparse graphs, false for dense graphs. A dense graph assumes the vertex IDs are in
     *        a contiguous sequence in [0, |V|), with |V| the total number of vertices inserted so far, while in a sparse graph
     *        a vertex ID can be any positive integer.
     * @param blind_writes: it affects consistency of edge insertions/deletions. If false, every time an insertion is performed,
     *        it checks whether that edge already exists, and, similarly, it only allows edge deletions for edges that already
     *        exist. This kind of explicit consistency is rather expensive on the current version of GraphOne. Enabling blind
     *        writes assumes that all edge insertions and deletions are correct, i.e. always refer to non existing or existing edges
     *        respectively, and the methods #add_edge and #remove_add always report success, unless the related vertices do not
     *        exist.
     * @param ignore_build: if true, it turns the method #build() into a nop. In GraphOne, new levels/snapshots/deltas are automatically
     *        created in the background. On the other hand, asking for a new delta to be explicitly created, by invoking the method
     *        build, it simply waits (in idle) for the next delta to be ready. Moreover, we can always retrieve the data from both
     *        the read store and the dynamic deltas, which is what the current implementation of the Graphalytics algorithms does.
     *        Therefore, even disabling the method #build() is expected to yield correct results for the experiments.
     * @param ref_gapbs: if true, in the Graphalytics algorithms, reuse the adapted versions from the GAP BS suite, similarly to llama-ref
     *        and stinger-ref. Otherwise, employ the native variants.
     * @param max_num_vertices: in GraphOne the array of vertices must be statically allocated in advance, with a fixed size.
     *        In a server environment, we set the capacity to 4G (= 2^32). For a workstation, this value is too high and does
     *        not enable creating an instance for testing purposes. This parameter allows to explicitly set the capacity of
     *        the vertex array.
